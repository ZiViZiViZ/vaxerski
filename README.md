I code, do graphics and play some games. That's pretty much it.<br/>
I support: English, 日本語, polski. *(other languages are under development)*<br/><br/>

**Hypr** [ uf ] is an X11 tiling window manager with unique features and a clean and expandable codebase.<br/>
**Harakiri** [ f? ] is a Minecraft Utility Mod for 1.12.2, aimed at anarchy servers. It has the best visuals, ever.<br/>
**Mosaic** [ f? ] is still one of my favorites, even if its code quality is questionable. (I was young, forgive me :P)<br/>
**ZoomWebcamFix** [ f ] was a fix that helped thousands of people whose webcams stopped working because of Zoom's poor code.<br/>
**Civ4RPC** [ f ] is a simple Discord RPC info collector for CIV4:BtS<br/>
*Just to name a few...*<br/><br/>
