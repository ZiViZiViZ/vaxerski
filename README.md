I code, do graphics and play some games. That's pretty much it.<br/><br/>

**Hypr** [ uf ] is an X11 tiling window manager with unique features and a clean and expandable codebase.
**Mosaic** [ f? ] is still one of my favorites, even if its code quality is questionable. (I was young, forgive me :P)<br/>
**ZoomWebcamFix** [ f ] was a fix that helped thousands of people whose webcams stopped working because of Zoom's poor code.<br/>
**Civ4RPC** [ f ] is a simple Discord RPC info collector for CIV4:BtS<br/>
*Just to name a few...*<br/><br/>

Harakiri, haraloader, my discord bot, just to name a few. :P<br/><br/>
